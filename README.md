# Chapter Workflow: Git and GitHub

## Git Conflict Resolve Test

This section is dedicated to testing how to resolve conflicts in Git. Conflicts occur when changes from different branches or commits overlap. (change here from upstream) To resolve a new conflict, you need to manually edit the conflicting files to reconcile the differences, then stage and commit the resolved changes.

- Create a conflict by modifying the same line in a file on two different branches.
- Edit the file to resolve the conflict.
- Attempt to merge the branches to trigger a conflict.
- Stage and commit the resolved file.
- Add changes from upstream
- Add more changes from upstream
- Add main branch changes

By practicing conflict resolution, you can ensure smooth collaboration in your projects.
